General
-------
We are currently in the process of migrating vegastrike.config (old, XML) to config.json (new, JSON).
As a result, the structure of the new file changes regularly and overwrites whatever changes the player has introduced.
As the first thing we ported was the graphics (resolution, monitor), 
this requires the player to manually edit the file after every relevant pull.

Solution
--------
There is a script, conveniently named overwrite_config_defaults, to do this automatically.
Copy all your changes to config.bak, preserving the relevant structure.

Example:
If this is your current config.json
"a": {
    "b": "modified value",
    "c": "unmodified value"
}

Create config.bak with the following:
"a": {
    "b": "modified value"
}

Place config.bak in the same folder as config.json (currently root of data).
Run the following from root
python3 python/utilities/overwrite_config_defaults

Your config.json should be updated with your changes.
