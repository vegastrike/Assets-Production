Hay There! I took a heck of a hard time to remake the new aera ships.
The following ships I remade so far is:
-Aeon
-Kyta
-Aevant
-Lekra
-Osprey
-Dagger

.. I still got the Kira and the Butterfly to go. The reason why I left out the Kira and
the Butterfly because the previous ships don't look flat compared to the others, but the
new version is soon to come. After thoe 2 are done, I'll probably decide if I want
to make new ships for the aera race or not.

The remake of those ships above were remade by Electrotech. i decided to remake them because
the first time I looked @ the ships, they were flat and boring looking. If you were to look
in the front view of the old ships, you see the wings are just lines as such.

catch ya later.
