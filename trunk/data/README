 Readme for VegaStrike version 0.2.9 Beta
=================================================
*--ADD STUFF HERE--*
Vegastrike has finally reached the state of being multisystem!
This means that many user requests have been accomplished including sound, joystick support, cloaking, bolt weapons, Target viewscreen, nebulae, asteroids, multiple systems, ingame-respawn... the list goes on
All of the ships are original, never before seen ships modelled by the Vegastrike team!
Mail me any comments or suggestions to vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net
And if you can design some missions it would rock!

=================================================
 The Update Utility
=================================================
The "Get Recent Update" program will allow you to get the most recent data for vegastrike.
It will first ask you whether you wish to update the update list.  This will allow you to get the most recent working code if you click "Update".
After choosing that option, you will be presented with a checkbox and a number of buttons.
The check box labeled "Restore Factory Defaults" will allow you to revert all of your modified files to the "factory defaults".
The next button says "Update to recent experimental data" and will update to the most recent developmental data.  When using this button, you may get a better game, but it will be experimental.
The rest of the buttons will update to previous or more recent releases.

=================================================
 Saving and Loading
=================================================
There should be a program named "Launcher" in the vegastrike directory.  This will give you a list of choices:

Select mission button - This allows you to select which mission vegastrike will start the next time you press one of the keys below it.  Most missions do not involve save games and will ignore those options, however the default, in the mission/exploration folder will indeed ustilize the save games you specify.  If you ignore this option you begin in the standard trading/bounty hunting mission.

Start a new game button - Start a new game in the Vegastrike universe.  You start with a dinged up old wayfarer and head from the vega sector with the hope of finding profit and adventure on the frontier.  To begin afresh you must choose a new saved game.

Load game button - This opens up a saved game you had finished playing before.  To save you must dock at the base and click on the save/load button and choose the save option.

Recover autosave button - This button allows a player to recover their most recently played game into the selected save game upon next run.  If the player quits or the player docks, and then dies, it will restore to the last saved position.

Launch last savegame button - Use this button to launch Vegastrike with from a saved game or mission.  If you do not choose a mission, you will start in the standard trading/bounty hunting mission.

Launch no savegame button - This button allows you to launch the selected mission without using a saved game.

Help button - This will print tis on a help window.

Exit launcher button - exits the launcher.

=================================================
 Running Vegastrike In Windows
=================================================
You can run the "Mission Launcher" program and select the correct mission.
Or, if you wish to play the default privateer mission, you may use the Launcher utility.
You can also use this for any other mission that uses a saved game (like the 2-player privateer mission.)

=================================================
 Running Vegastrike From the Command Line
=================================================
Vegastrike takes a single command parameter indicating which mission it should load

	.\vegastrike mission/explore_universe.mission

is an example of a valid mission call.

The -j flag (must be flush with the system) will force a player to begin in a star system.

	.\vegastrike -jvega_sector/vega mission/n_vs_n/confed/confed_2v2.mission

will force the 2v2 mission to run in the vega sector.

=================================================
 Playing Music in Vegastrike in Windows (Experemintal)
=================================================
Run setup.exe and select Windows External Music.
Put 3 .m3u playlists in the .vegastrike folder that must be called peace.m3u battle.m3u and panic.m3u.  Winamp can create such files.
As vegastrike currently does not have music artists, you must choose the playlists for yourself.  Songs towards the top get played more often
During better times...songs on the bottom get played more often during worse times.

=================================================
 Docking to a Planet or a Capship
=================================================
If you wish to earn money, you will need to know how to dock.
If you wish to get clearence to land at the base or planet, you must communicate that you wish to land by pressing the '0' key.
In order to dock to starships, you must press 'd' and to undock, press 'd' again or press 'u'.
Once docked at the planet or base, you may press '0' again to leave your starship and enter the base.
See the next sections for more information about the bases.

=================================================
 Accepting Missions
=================================================
You must accept missions to earn money.  The first step is to click on the "Mission BBS" button.  This will give you a list of mission categories.  You will then need to click on the category name
There will be missions to attack targets in the Attack  categories.
In the Neutral category, there will be neutral missions like patroling, escorting and scouting.
Finally, the Confed, Aera, Pirate, Rlaan or Retro categories will give you missions to diliver cargo, search for contraband or escort ships to other places.  
Once you have bought the missions, you may check your cockpit screen to see the instructions for the missions.
When you have completed them, your credits will immediately be added to your account.

=================================================
 Trading Cargo
=================================================
If you wish, you may buy cargo at your base.

=================================================
 Interstellar Warp Transit (Jump Drive)
=================================================
Most starships come equipped with a warp drive.  Unfortunately they can only be used at large singularities in the space-time continuum.  Your computer signals these points by placing glowing blue balls in those areas.  Their relative size indicates how small a starship must be to fit through the jump point.
To engage a jump drive, position your ship inside and press 'j'.
Regulations state that starships should be stopped before jumping-- disasters have resulted from starships travelling at any great speed into a jump point.
You do not come equipped with one at the beginning, so you must do missions to earn enough money to buy one.

=================================================
 Time Compression / Autopilot
=================================================
Often interstellar travel requires going great distances. To facilitate this, we have provided time compression.  Press F9 to increase time compression to get where you're going.  Press F10 to drop out of time compression.  F10 will happen automatically if enemies are nearby.
If going twoards a big object, like a planet, you may autopilot there by pressing Shift-A.

=================================================
 ReSpawn
=================================================
If you sadly lose your life in combat you may respawn by pressing ';'
A new starship will be created for you by Bob.

=================================================
 Ordering Wingmen
=================================================
If you are in a mission with more than 1 ship in your flightgroup you may order them to do certain things.
Press shift-F to have them form on your wing and follow you through jump points
Press shift-A to have them attack your target
press shift-H to have them attack the object attacking you
Press shift-B to release them from the above orders
Wingmen are fickle and may not always obey your commands.  They will inform you if they do or not.

=================================================
 Communications with Friends and Foes
=================================================
When flying in space one may wish to engage in casual conversation with nearby starships.
Target a starship and press a number key to communicate with the ship.
Conversation topics are generally ordered from nice (low numbers) to threatening (high numbers), however you may wish to change your vdu to comm mode (press 'v' to cycle to it) in order to see exactly what you will say to your target.
If you choose particularly menacing taunts, the target may get angry and attack you instead of its current target.
Likewise often one can use the comms to restore relationships with hostile people.
Be careful as the local authorities may choose to scan your ship for contraband.  If you refuse to fly straight during this process you may be attacked!

=================================================
 Transfer Command
=================================================
if you wish to transfer command to another starship, simply press '[' to switch over.  This is useful if you have died and do not wish to upset the blaance.  The AI that took over for the ship you left will attack your previously targetted unit, be it friendly or enemy.  You can use this to in effect give orders to friends.

=================================================
 Turrets
=================================================
Turrets do not begin with their own AI at all times.  To toggle the AI of your turret, you must press 'o'. Pressing this when your turret is off will turn on your turret and tell it to attack your target.  Pressing o again will turn off your turret and make it sit idle.
Turrets can be told to attack your target.  do this by pressing 'shift-P'.  once they attack your target you may switch your target and they will continue to attack the target you told them to.
 
Press ']' to physically go to a turret.
Press ']' to return to cockpit again. Another press of ']' will get you to your next turret, and so forth.
Like with Transfer command, the AI of the turret will attack your previously targetted object when you leave the turret.

 Editing Missions
=================================================

How to make Vegastrike Missions
An example mission(this is stored in the test1.mission file)
A mission must begin with the headers:

<mission>
	<variables>
		<var name="defaultplayer" value="blue" 
		<var name="mission_name" value="Test Mission"  
		<var name="splashscreen" value="bad_guys_vs_good_guys.bmp"  
		<var name="system" value="sol"  
		<var name="description" value="This is a fun mission."  
		<var name="author" value="Me"  
		<var name="briefing" value="In this mission, you will have to have fun, or you will fail."  
	</variables>

it loads sol.system  as the star system (which is in XML and stores all present planets)
The only other system included in this beta release is the blank.mission
which has 1 planet, 1 sun and 2 starbases.
After this, comes the actors in the mission, the flightgroups of fighters.
        <flightgroups>
You must begin the flight group tag as above, and terminate it after all of your flight groups

                <flightgroup name="blue" faction="confed" type="nova" ainame="default" waves="8" nr_ships="3">
The name will be used later for targetting and offset purposes.  The faction is a faction listed in factions.xml (should be self explanatory 0 is neutral 1 is happy -1 is mad) Currently confed and aera are the two active factions.  AI must be default in this version as no ohter AI scripts are yet written.  nr_ships indicates how many starships will be in this flight squadron.
			<pos x="10000.0" y="0.0" z="3000.0" 
This indicates the flight group's position... be sure it is unique
			<rot x="180.0" y="180.0" z="180.0" 
			<order order="tmptarget" target="omikron" 
			<order priority="0" order="superiority" target="enemy" 
			<order priority="1" order="bomber" target="omikron" 
			<order priority="2" order="escort" target="blue" 
the rest is in development
		</flightgroup>
you must end all flight group tags
continue with any other flightgroups... you can have as many as you want from as many named factions are you want...
      </flightgroups>
</mission>

=================================================
 Editing AI
=================================================

The AI is completely scriptable, and I have not spent all that long perfecting it.  There are included instructions about editing the AI scripts yourself.
Currently there is only 1 AI personality.  In the future there will be a method to assign different personalities to different starships.
it's the "default" personality.
2 files are responsible for the control of the "default" personality
default.agg.xml
and 
default.int.xml

default.agg.xml means the "aggressive" AI.  it controls what it does to aggressively bring its vengence upon its target.
When editing this file in notepad, you'll notice some tags and various numbers.
The first tag, AggressiveAI has a parameter time="4"
that's how often the AI checks if it should change its strategy.  This time can be any integer value... it can revise its plan more often or less often. 4 has been good because most maneuvers can mostly complete in 4 seconds and it's a good time to revise plans
underneath the beginning tag exist a list of tags that describes the logic the AI uses to figure out its next strategy.
there are a number of tags you can specify for the aggressive AI: distance, threat, hull, fshield lshield rshield bshield rand
Each tag asserts if one of the tag-values above is between min and max.
The AI needs to make a CHOICE about what it does next, so it takes a look at the list of tags and determines if any of the assertions is true.
Nested statements mean that BOTH must be true. so you can say "if the distance is at most .5 and the hull is between .25 and .75 by writing:
<distance max=".5">
  <hull min=".25" max=".75" script="afterburnerslide.xml">
  </hull>
</distance>

this means "if the distance is at most half the range of my guns and the hull is between 1/4 and 3/4 of its capacity, then perform an afterburner slide.
It goes down the list of such assertions and chooses the appropriate AI script to run.
The facing and movement tags fill in the gaps where NONE of the list of the assertions are true and the ship is not either turning or moving anywhere:
<facing script="turntowards.xml">
</facing>

at the very bottom the </AggressiveAI> must show up to indicate that the AIscript has terminated.

The aggressive.int.xml is written out exactly the same as the aggressive.agg.xml
the difference is that scripts listed here INTERRUPT the current action!
An example from the game is:
<AggressiveAI close=".05">
  <hull max = ".5" script="evade.xml">
   <threat min=".4" script="afterburnerslide.xml">
   </threat>
  </hull>

  <distance max=".03" script="turnaway.xml">
  <!-- distance less than .1-->
  </distance>
  
</AggressiveAI>

this says:
If the hull is at most half and someone is threatening me with a 40% chance to hit... then evade and then afterburner slide
OR
if someone is at most .03 of my max range away from me TURN AWAY!

this will interrupt the current progress of any scripts

So that's how to use AI scripts.
If you want to know more about writing actual maneuvers (like turnaway.xml  which as you can see is in the directory) please contact me at hellcatv@hotmail.com
you need to have a heavy background in vector math.
