<!-- well here we go - This is the Capital ship AI. When I think cap ship, I think big ships hitting eachother with big guns, so
	Damage evasion will be minimal (too bulky), we'll focus more on setting up a superior position to do the most damage

	Ok here's what we'll need:
	Collision
	Flee
	Some sort of damage evasion - move out of larger ships range firing arc?
	Attack script from 10K - hardcoded limit
	Long distacne
	
	Priorities
	Collision 8
	Flee 7
	damage evasion 6 -No sense in damage Evasion ATM
	Attack 5
	Long range 4
	
	Should damage evasion and attack be switched - Ie, I'm a huge ship no sense in manuevouring, just hit them harder than they
	hit me?

Ok - Most cap ship have fixed forward weapons + turrets. At long range the Ship will turn towards its target. Once in close,
is gonna want to do some sort of circle around the target while keeping main guns pined on it.-->
