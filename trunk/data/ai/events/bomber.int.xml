<!-- Ok, um What the heck is this file? When is it used? What the heck is AGGRESSIVEAI CLOSE=".05"?? 

--Um ok... I removed the file to see what teh AI would do. It seems when the AI has no target (not in fight)
This file might be defualted to. With the file removed, the bombers, just kinda, sit there and spin in circles... As oppossed
to just sitting there when the file is there (ie match velocity would return 0 - nothing to match right?)

-- Ok, I did some test where the bombers will always win - no draws. Everything, Bombers, fighters, just sitss and spins...

SO I still have no clue the purpose of this file. There's no Fighter.init so It can't be required. Besides there's no 
VegaPersonalities.csv to would set the AI as Init, right? 

Sorta - According to the AI source code, the interrupt file name is name.int.xml IT looks like it tries to load a normal AI(specified
by the CSV's) or an int (why?). Failing that it loads .agg. then default.agg.xml, then crashes-->

<AggressiveAI close=".05" time="15">

 <meterdistance max="1000" script="loop around" time="15" timetointerrupt="15" priority="1">
  </meterdistance>

  
  <!-- New crap , perhaps turn towrds a new target and head that way? -->
 <meterdistance min="1000" script="turn towards" time="15" timetointerrupt="10" priority="1">
  </meterdistance>

</AggressiveAI>
