How the AI Picks its XML: VegaEvent.VegaPersonalities.XML

Ok First the AI gets the target and AI Combat role from Units.CSV. Then, using VegaEvents.csv as a chart (target=Row, AI=Column)
The cross is the first name of the XML. (bomber targeting base = bomber)
Then, the AI consults VegaPersonalities.XML in this File the Column is the AI's faction. The row are the names of the middle
section of the XML. The AI picks one at random. (ie agg,agg,civ is 66% change of agg, 33% chance of civ)

It looks like it tries to load a normal AI(specified by the CSV's) or an int (why?). Failing that it loads .agg. 
then default.agg.xml, then crashes

 header AggressiveAI - time how often to search for scripts in the event.xml max of 15 from source code i think
 
 Arguements things: all can be min/max or not (not sure how "not" works though, possibly for thing that return y/n? 
 ie 1/0?)

Distance				Normalized distance value 0-1
MeterDistance			Meter version - speed and intertial calculated in, max of 10000?
Threat					from the source: value = parent->GetComputerData().threatlevel; Not sure of result range?
FShield					% shield in decimal 0-1
LShield
RShield
BShield
Hull					% hull in decimal 0-1
Facing					?not sure - Is the AI facing the target 0/1?
Movement				Is our AI moving? 0/1?
FShield_Heal_Rate		change in shield over 1 sec - looks like % in decimal 0-1
BShield_Heal_Rate
LShield_Heal_Rate
RShield_Heal_Rate
FArmor_Heal_Rate		0 seems hard set to zero except...
BArmor_Heal_Rate
LArmor_Heal_Rate
RArmor_Heal_Rate		0.5 not sure why... ask devs?
Hull_Heal_Rate			change in hull over 1 sec - looks like % in decimal 0-1 - didn't know the hull could heal....
Target_Faces_You		0 or 1. No or Yes. Does the target face the AI?
Target_In_Front_Of_You	0 or 1. No or Yes   Is the target in front of the AI?
Rand					Random number generator - 0-1
Target_Going_Your_Direction 0 or 1. No or Yes.
 
 Then
 script			- tells AI to run a script
 time			- max length of time to run script for
 timetointerupt	- length of time to run script uninterupted
 priority		- sets the value of interuptability of the script. Only scripts with a higher priority can interupt and
					only if timetointerupt is not running (or finished running)
 
 It appears looking at some of the AI event.xml's, that one can string several conditions to one script or several conditions
	several scripts. However, It does not appear that one condition can activate several scripts in a string. Each, event must
	be separate.

 afterburn evade				Modified evade up/down/left/right w/afterburner on
 afterburn evade left right	    fire up afterburners and wiggle to the left and right
 afterburn evade up down	    fire up afterburners and wiggle up and down
 afterburn fly straight	     	flight afterburners and fly in a straight line
 afterburn turn away	       	turn away from target using afterburners if available
 afterburn turn towards	     	turn towards the center of the target with full afterburners
 afterburn turn towards itts	turn towards where the target will be given the gun speed (lead) and shoot
 afterburn vector away          vectors thrusters away from the target while turning away from target and hitting afterburners
 afterburn veer away     	    vectors thrusters away from the target while facing it and shooting with afterburners engaged
 afterburner slide				aim slightly away from the target, fire afterburners forward then aim towards the target and shoot
 aggressive loop around  	    uses whatever mode is selected in the vegastrike.config for use_afterburners and vectors thrust to above or to the left or right of the target in an effort to get past it and get on its tail while aiming at it with its guns
 aggressive loop around fast	hits the afterburners and vectors the thrusters to left or above the target while facing it and shooting at it and eventually coming around behind it
 aggressive loop around slow    uses normal thruster to vector thrust just above or to the left or right of the target in an effort to pass it and get behind the target while shooting at it
 barrel roll                    hits the pitch and roll keys at the same time to get a corkscrew effect
 cloak	    					cloak and evade
 coast to stop	      			slow down to a stop
 do nothing	     				do not adjust velocity vector or turn--if target is in sights then shoot otherwise do nothing

 kick stop	     				stop as fast as possible
 loop around                    uses whatever mode is selected in the vegastrike.config for use_afterburners and aims to above or to the left or right of the target in an effort to get past it and get on its tail
 loop around fast               hits the afterburner and aims just to the left or above or right of the target in order to hopefully pass it and come around on its tail     
 loop around slow               uses normal thrusters and aims just above or to the left or right of the target in an effort to pass it and get behind it
 match velocity                 vectors thrusters such that the target velocity is matched
 move to 	      				fly to where the target is and stop

 roll right hard	         	do a right roll full power
 self destruct	      			unknown
 shelton slide	      			keep velocity the same while turning towards target

 <!-- found some new ones in hard_coded_scripts.cpp -->
 FacePerpendicularFast;			Looking at the code, It looks like these things loop around while changing direction??
 FacePerpendicular;				"Orbits target while facing it"
 FacePerpendicularSlow;
 RollFacePerpendicularFast;		I got no idea... same thing while doing a barrel roll?
 RollFacePerpendicular;			They all have the same orders in the CPP files facePerdendicular - just different varialbes:
 RollFacePerpendicularSlow;		Ie true,true,true, or something - So all of these are essentially variations of the same move
