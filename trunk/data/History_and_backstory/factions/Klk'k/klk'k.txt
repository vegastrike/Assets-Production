Faction: Klk'k

The Klk'k are a client race of the Andolians, but enjoy exceptional freedom within this position.  Indeed, while fiercely loyal to their Andolian benefactors, there exist a non-trivial number of independently operated Klk'k vessels.  The Klk'k are perhaps best known for their odd brand of twisted humor.
