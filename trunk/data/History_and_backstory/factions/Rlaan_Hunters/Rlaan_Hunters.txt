Faction: Rlaan_Hunters

Formed post contact with humanity, the Rlaan Hunters are almost entirely composed of sterile Worker/Warrior hybrids who failed in the political arena.  Although too Rlaan culture was coherent to have had to deal the issues that plagued Human space, these Rlaan were quite happy to offer to try out their solutions - for a fee.
