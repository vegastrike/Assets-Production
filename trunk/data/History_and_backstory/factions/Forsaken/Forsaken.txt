Faction: Forsaken

The Forsaken are not a lucky bunch.  Their intended homeworlds got hijacked when they got leapfrogged by the newly invented ftl transports.  Arriving hopelessly out of synch with the rest of human society, these groups found they had more in common with each other than anyone else, and set out to colonize the worlds no one else had wanted to.
