Faction: Rlaan_Saahasayaay

The most successful of the Rlaan uplifts, the Saahasayaay are incredibly dextrous and possessed of a carnivore's keen hunting sense.  The Rlaan have taken to using Saahasayaay troops to reinforce their border with the Aera.  The Rlaan are, however somewhat hesitant to let this concentration of troops return home.
