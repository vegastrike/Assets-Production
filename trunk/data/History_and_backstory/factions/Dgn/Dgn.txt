Faction: Dgn

The Dgn, like the Shmrn, are the result of Shaper experiments with induced sentience.  One often wonders though, if the amphibious Dgn wouldn't be happier to have their ignorance back, as their lives are rather short and, given the relative dryness of the environments favored by their masters, often somewhat unpleasant.
