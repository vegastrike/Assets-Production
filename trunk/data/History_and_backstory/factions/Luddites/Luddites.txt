Faction: Luddites

Beginning as an extremist branch of the Purists, these anti-technologists dream of a humanity blissing away in an agrarian fashion.  Having been disowned by the Purists, and having been long since reviled by all other memegroups for both their philosophy and, more importantly, their disposition towards military action in support of said philosophy, the Luddites are hunted all over Confederation Space.
