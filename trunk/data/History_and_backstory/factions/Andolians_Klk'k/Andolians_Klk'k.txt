Faction: Andolians_Klk'k

The Klk'k client race was saved by the Andolians from destruction and servitude at the hands of a now defunct human memegroup.  The most advanced pre-contact client race, the Klk'k enjoy more freedom than any other known client race, yet still are steadfastly loyal to the Andolians.  This loyalty stems not only from the Klk'k belief that they owe the Andolians a vast debt of honor, but also that the Andolians benevolent treatment of the Klk'k has caused the Klk'k to see the Andolians as Big Brother figures.
