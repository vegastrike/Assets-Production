Faction: Shmrn

The Shmrn (a genetic modification on the Dgn), having been freed from torturous slavery to the Lightbearers, were given an Andolian Colony ship and set off armward.  They settled on a marshy world of wide shallow seas that was as close to a paradise as they felt themselves likely to find.  Settling on this planet, they advanced in some degree of isolation, keeping contact only with the Andolians and Klk'k.
