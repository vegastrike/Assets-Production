Faction: Purists

A surprisingly large memegroup, and the dominant one in Sol, the Purists seek a humanity free of changes to the species.  They do not stand for genetic modification, nor for cybernetic implants.  They are, however, not opposed to technology that is not used to alter humans.  Motto: In being what we are, become all that we can be.
