Faction: Merchants

Growing from the first of the FTL cartels, the Merchanter group attracted adherents from many memegroups.  Those who joined flocked to the motto: grab, put, generate, grow!  Though they do not possess as many worlds as any of the other major memegroups, their economic clout makes them powerful.
