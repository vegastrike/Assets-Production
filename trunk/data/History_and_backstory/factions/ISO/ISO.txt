Faction: ISO

Undoubtedly one of the oddest, albeit not smallest, memegroups, the Interstellar Socialist Organization seeks to return to the (increasingly few, due to automation) workers of the inhabited galaxy, the control over the means of production.  Notwithstanding the fact that this has more or less happened in some of the memegroups, nor that some of the memegroups no longer have an economy where this arrangement is coherrent, they still seek to have everyone join their utopian dream.  Due to prompting from major factions opposed to such a vision, the confederacy has banned membership in this memegroup.
