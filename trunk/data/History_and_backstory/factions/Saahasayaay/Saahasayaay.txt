Faction: Saahasayaay

Fast, beautiful, and deadly, the Saahasayaay are Rlaan uplifts, but, while they serve the Rlaan, they do so because of the technological and economic benefits gained from the association rather than out of gratitude.  Whereas the Rlaan succeeded in making both the Lmpl and Nuhln useful and docile, the Saahasayaay are indeed useful, but far from docile.
