Faction: Unadorned_Mishtali

Though nearly all see it as further proof of insanity, the Unadorned let some Mishtali fly spaceships.  Notably, in a move more resembling logical reasoning, the Unadorned don't let the Mishtali fly very well equipped spaceships, make the Mishtali promise to not eat anyone that didn't die of natural causes, and always ask them to play nice with the other children.
