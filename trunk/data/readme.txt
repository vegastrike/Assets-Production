*  3) Tutorial -- Starting a New Game -- Making a few Credits *

*Windows Users*
To start a new Vegastrike game, click on the Vega Strike Launcher from
the Start Menu.
Click on "New Game"
Type in the save game you wish to save to when you choose save at a base.
Click "ok" and Vegastrike should launch. Be patient while it generates
BSP trees for the system. This will only happen the first time.
*Mac Users*
Drag VegaStrike.app to the Applications directory.
Double Click on VegaStrike.app
*Linux Users*
Install the rpm
run vsinstall from the terminal
run vslauncher from the terminal

When the game starts you will be docked to a station. You can walk
around the station by clicking on various doors or if you cannot see a
mouse cursor you can right click to select the different options and
left click to select the corresponding door.
Look in the bar to see if there are any people to talk to. If you run
into one you will find that they often offer good deals--and sometimes
launch you into great plots! You may find particularly interesting
people in Heinlein and other interesting systems. Scout about, use
shift-M in flight to bring up a nice map of nearby sectors. These are
the ones where most of the plot points take place.
You will find yourself at the controls of an old starship known as the
wayfarer. You may wish to read the introduction story for some
information about how you got to where you are sitting.
Your wayfarer has an old, out of date, targetting system. You will need
to face the targets on your radar before you can necessarily target them.
Press t a few times to survey your surroundings. Locate a planet named
Agricultural:Barnoose by turning and pressing 't' consecutively until
you see it in your right hud. Then press *a* to turn on autopilot. This
will move the camera into pan- mode and speed up time until your ship
has arrived near your target.
When you exit Autopilot you _may_ encounter pirates, Aera, or other
unfriendlies. If this is the case you perhaps should turn your ship,
press *h* a few times to pick the targets in front of you, and engage
them! *H* cycles through hostile targets. They should not be difficult
at this stage of the game, so they should be easy kills.
If your "AUTO" Light is on, however, you know that you are home free.
Your radar, however does not give an indication of starships intent
towards you, so you must be cautious until you can afford a better one.
Turn back to the large earth-like Agricultural planet and press *p*
until "Agricultural:Barnoose" is in your right screen (If you miss it
hit *p* until you are back). P picks the target closest to your nose...
it is an easy way to select targets. keep it target. request docking
clearence. A green or red box should appear around your planet. A box
turns red if it is behind the unit or in a wall, and turns green if it
is on your side of the unit
With the onset of life-sized planets, you must spend a large chunk of
time to actually get near enough to the surface to dock, so you could
engage time compression.
press "+" until your speed is around 300, then hit F9 around 10-16 times
to speed time enough to quickly engage the dockin clamps. Around 300
seconds later (compressed as you have into about 10), a green box will
appear indicating that you are close enough to dock. press 'd' and your
comm screen will tell you if you have success.
Once the comm screens say "Docking Operation Begun". You immediately
step out of your ship onto the planet.
Agricultural planets sell food, so peruse the cargo list and get food by
clicking on Natural Resources then "Food". Stock up with your cash. You
should be able to get enough Grain and Generic Food to fill your cargo bay.
Buy the food and then Click on the Save/Load button on the top right

Then go to the menu (where the cargo used to be) and click SAVE
You will get a confirmation dialog. Next time you run the Launcher you
should Open up your saved game to continue from where you left off.
Click done on the bottom right. We have some nice foodstuffs, lets
deliver them to a base where they are needed.

Find your way back to your ship and click on it to launch.

We want to run this food to a mining base. Lets try our good mining base
Outer Rings--they're often in need of food with these pirates around,
and cut off trade routes.
Target Outer Rings with *t*, and then hit *a* to get there.
Again you may encounter some enemies.... prepare to engage them!
When you reach close enough to see and then fly into a green guide box,
press 'd' again to dock.
Once inside the base, you will se the docking screen, like before.
Except this time, you should click on SellMode to get a list of Items.
Browse through the Food categories like you did before. You should see
the same cargo that you bought back at the planet. Select both of them.
Notice that the prices are greater; you can sell them for more than you
bought them for! so click on the SellCargo button until all of your
cargo is gone.
By doing this, you get some cash for spending. You should maybe buy
something usefil with this money, like an afterburner to allow you to go
a lot faster. Go to UpgradeShip an select Engines. Then you will see
Light and Engine Enhancements Light. To get an afterburner, choose
afterburner_generic from the Engine Enhancements Light category. about
2700 credits should have immediately been deducted from your account and
you should immediately have an afterburner installed on your ship.
Make sure to go to the Load/Save button in the top right and click on
SAVE. Otherwise if you forgot you could go to the launcher and recover
your auto save to your game, but if you encounter an undesirable
situation, this could leave you with fewer options. We recommend saving
after conducing landing operations.
You can do missions as well to earn money. To find a list of missions,
go to the MissionBBS. The categories are listed by who offered the
mission or who you have to kill. Make sure not to take missions where
you kill someone you wish to be an ally of. Killing units of a given
race affects your relationship with them far more than merely taunting
them, so be careful who you choose to be your friends.
In the beginning it would be wise to take cargo missions and simple
scout and patrol missions. Make sure you select missions that occur "in
system"... many missions require you to jump out of system to complete
them, and you need at least 9000 credits to afford a jump drive.
This is one of the most important improvements you can get for your
starship. It will allow you to complete many more missions and explore a
better part of the galaxy.

If mission directions get lost in the battle chatter use page up and
page down to scroll through the messages and find the directions you
need to complete a mission.

So take a mission, take off, and prepare to meet your destiny!

* 4) Saving and Loading*

*This is for PC and Linux users only! Mac users: don't worry; all the
Vega Strike savegames are in your home directory under .vegastrike.
change the save game by editing save.txt* There should be a program
named "Launcher" in the vegastrike directory or start menu. This will
give you a list of choices:
Select mission button This allows you to select which mission vegastrike
will start the next time you press one of the keys below it. Most
missions do not involve save games and will ignore those options,
however the default, in the mission/exploration folder will indeed
ustilize the save games you specify. If you ignore this option you begin
in the standard trading/bounty hunting mission.
Start a new game button Start a new game in the Vegastrike universe. You
start with a dinged up old wayfarer and head from the vega sector with
the hope of finding profit and adventure on the frontier. To begin
afresh you must choose a new saved game.
Load game button This opens up a saved game you had finished playing
before. To save you must dock at the base and click on the save/load
button and choose the save option. /NOTE that if you choose the LOAD
button from a base IN GAME, your ship will be destroyed so you can press
respawn (semicolon) and continue where you last saved from!/ This is not
quite as intuitive as we would have hoped :-(.
Recover autosave button This button allows a player to recover their
most recently played game into the selected save game upon next run. If
the player quits or the player docks, and then dies, it will restore to
the last saved position.
Launch last savegame button Use this button to launch Vegastrike with
from a saved game or mission. If you do not choose a mission, you will
start in the standard trading/bounty hunting mission.
Launch no savegame button This button allows you to launch the selected
mission without using a saved game.
Help button This will print tis on a help window.
Exit launcher button exits the launcher.


* 5) The Update Utility*

The "Get Recent Update" program will allow you to get the most recent
data for vegastrike.
It will first ask you whether you wish to update the update list. This
will allow you to get the most recent working code if you click "Update".
After choosing that option, you will be presented with a checkbox and a
number of buttons.
The check box labeled "Restore Factory Defaults" will allow you to
revert all of your modified files to the "factory defaults".
The next button says "Update to recent experimental data" and will
update to the most recent developmental data. When using this button,
you may get a better game, but it will be experimental.
The rest of the buttons will update to previous or more recent releases.


* 6) Running Vegastrike In Windows*

Make sure you have the most recent nVidia drivers. Old nvidia drivers
cause problems with display lists and compiled vertex arrays.!!
After completing setup, run the Launcher program. Select the mission you
wish to play then run it by clicking on "New Game" and typing in a save
game (or else by clicking run without save game if it is a simple mission)
The default mission is recommended for an introduction to the Vegastrike
trading universe. To get the default mission you need not select the
mission initially.

* 7) Running Vegastrike From the Command Line*

Vegastrike takes a single command parameter indicating which mission it
should load
.\vegastrike mission/explore_universe.mission
is an example of a valid mission call.

The -j flag (must be flush with the system) will force a player to begin
in a star system.
.\vegastrike -jvega_sector/vega mission/n_vs_n/confed/confed_2v2.mission
will force the 2v2 mission to run in the vega sector.

* 8) Playing Music in Vegastrike*

Make sure music is on. Some of the plot depends on it! it's all included
this time!.
* 9) Docking to a Planet or a Capship*

If you wish to earn money, you will need to know how to dock.
First of all, plabnets without a type on them on the right vdu are
inhabitable and do not have any cargo on them.
Myplanet
But if it has a type on it on the right vdu, feel free to dock to it!
industrial:Myplanet

If you wish to get clearence to land at the base or planet, you must
communicate that you wish to land by targetting a base and flying near it.
In order to dock to starships, you must press 'd' once inside the green box.

* 10) Accepting Missions*

You must accept missions to earn money. The first step is to click on
the "Mission BBS" button. This will give you a list of mission
categories. You will then need to click on the category name
There will be missions to attack targets in the Attack categories.
In the Neutral category, there will be neutral missions like patroling,
escorting and scouting.
Finally, the Confed, Aera, Pirate, Rlaan or Retro categories will give
you missions to diliver cargo, search for contraband or escort ships to
other places.
Once you have bought the missions, you may check your cockpit screen to
see the instructions for the missions.
When you have completed them, your credits will immediately be added to
your account.

* 11) Trading Cargo*

You may buy cargo at the base that you are docked to.
To find the list of cargo, use the Buy Mode button. When you click on
it, you will most likely find a list of categories. (If you don't, then
the planet or capship that you are docked at doesn't sell cargo.)
After browsing through the categories, you should select the Cargo that
you want to buy.
The selected item will be blue, with the name and the quantity in the
base in parentheses.
Jade (3)
On the right side of the screen, there will be the item, the price, the
mass and the volume.
Jade
Price: 124.83
Mass: 0.01
Cargo Volume: 1.00
To buy it, simply click the "Buy Cargo" button at the bottom.
Different planets or bases will have different prices and quantities for
groups of items. For example, Mining Bases will have cheaper minerals.

After buying cargo, you may want to go to a planet that is in need of
that cargo. When you are done docking at that planet, you may go the
Sell Cargo screen.
In the sell mode, you will see the same categories, except only those of
the items that you bought. Find your item again and click on it. Notice
that the price has changed, but everything else has stayed the same.
Click The "Sell Cargo" button if you wish to sell it, and you will
immediately be rewarded with your credits.
Note: you should NOT go the "upgrades" or "starships" categories if you
want to buy a ship or upgrade it UNLESS you wish to have a starship or
upgrade in your cargo hold.

* 12) Upgrading and Downgrading your Ship*

If you want your ship to get better (so you can do more missions and
kill harder enemies), you will have to eventually upgrade your junky ship.
You must click on the "Upgrade Ship" button to get a list of possible
upgrade categories. Browse through them until you find a good Upgrade
that you need.
The screen will look similar to the cargo section, with the name and the
quantity in parentheses. If you click "Buy", you may see one of many things:

If the computer says that the ship may not entirely fit on your ship, it
is saying that not all of the upgrade may be used. For example, if you
add fuel to your ship and you have only used up half of a fuel item, it
will say that the fuel may not fit. You usually should just click Yes.

It may also ask you which mount to place the gun, missle or turret on.
Mounts with brackets [] on are empty mounts. Select which mount to put
it on.
Laser
[LIGHT MEDIUM HEAVY ]
ImageRecognition
Here you could put another laser or beam in the LIGHT MEDIUM HEAVY mount
because it can hold those categories.

Downgrading works the same way. If you need to earn more money, just
click the Downgrade button. It will give you a list of caregories of
items on your ship.
When you have the item that you wish to sell, make sure that you have
selected the best item in that category. For example, you may have an
"engine_level_0" and an "engine_level_1" in the list you should
downgrade the engine_level_1 if you want to get more money out of the item.

* 13) Buying a new ship*

Buying a ship is simple, if you have enough money. Just go to the Ship
dealer and select the ship that you want.
The ships ending with ".blank" are blank ships. You will have to buy
upgrades to put on them before they are flyable.
The wayfarer.begin may also be listed; it is the same ship that you
started with.
There are a very few ships without these endings that come pre-equipped
without those endings. You can buy those ships and then you will not
have to put upgrades on.
Once you buy a new ship, your old ship is stored in the current system.
You can switch between ships of different type for free. You can own up
to one ship of each type (you can own a blank and non blank version of a
ship even). It costs 6000 to ship a starship to a different system, and
it is free to switch to a ship in your own system. Click on My Fleet in
the Ship Dealer section of the computer. You will find that you wish to
"collect them all" so to speak. All your upgrades are saved, so you
needn't sell them back for half price. Enjoy this new feature.

* 14) Briefings and News (Experemintal)*

Briefings and news have not been added yet. They will come in next release.

* 15) Interstellar Warp Transit (Jump Drive)*

Most starships come equipped with a warp drive. Unfortunately they can
only be used at large singularities in the space-time continuum. Your
computer signals these points by placing glowing blue balls in those
areas. Their relative size indicates how small a starship must be to fit
through the jump point.
To engage a jump drive, position your ship inside and press 'j'.
Regulations state that starships should be stopped before jumping--
disasters have resulted from starships travelling at any great speed
into a jump point.
You do not come equipped with one at the beginning, so you must do
missions to earn enough money to buy one.

* 16) Time Compression / Autopilot*

Often interstellar travel requires going great distances. To facilitate
this, we have provided time compression. Press F9 to increase time
compression to get where you're going. Press F10 to drop out of time
compression. F10 will happen automatically if enemies are nearby.
If going towards a big object, like a planet, you may autopilot there by
pressing Shift-A.

* 17) Match Velocity Key*

In space all speeds are relative...Flightrgroups can be travelling at
great velocity with respect to a surrounding sun yet appear to be idly
drifting into space. A player may instruct his computer to match
velocity of a starship by pressing the 'home' key on the keypad. This
will set '0' to be the speed of that starship. Backspace will assure
that your ship is stationary relative to the other starship (unless it
accelerates faster than you and is accelerating).
To stop matching velocity press the 'end' key on the keypad.

* 18) Tractor Beam*

A tractor beam is just like a normal beam weapon except that it exerts a
small force upon its target. If the target is small relative to your
ship or is a chunk of cargo, holding a tractor beam on it will cause the
cargo to come towards you and eventually enter your hold. It is almost
impossible to tractor cargo that is moving with respect to your ship, so
the suggestion is to press 'home' to match velocity with the cargo, and
then to press backspace to stop... this will allow one to pick up cargo
with ease.


* 19) ReSpawn*

If you sadly lose your life in combat you may respawn by pressing ';'
(Player 2 can respawn with '.' )
Your game will be loaded with your last saved file..

* 20) Ordering Wingmen*

If you are in a mission with more than 1 ship in your flightgroup you
may order them to do certain things.
Press shift-F to have them form on your wing and follow you through jump
points
Press shift-D to have them attack your target
press shift-H to have them attack the object attacking you
Press shift-B to release them from the above orders
Wingmen are fickle and may not always obey your commands. They will
inform you if they do or not.
Certain missions will require you to escort people to places. Your
escorts will follow you whever you go, and they will autopilot with you
to your destination. If you hit auto just before the jump point they
will go beside you. Then stop in the jump point, wait until they get
near, and then press 'j'. They will follow you through the jump and
appear on the other side. Voilla! Then continue to the next destination.
Getting escorts right is essential to completing the plot missions in
Heinlein.
* 21) Communications with Friends and Foes*

When flying in space one may wish to engage in casual conversation with
nearby starships.
Target a starship and press a number key to communicate with the ship.
Conversation topics are generally ordered from nice (low numbers) to
threatening (high numbers), however you may wish to change your vdu to
comm mode (press 'v' to cycle to it) in order to see exactly what you
will say to your target.
If you choose particularly menacing taunts, the target may get angry and
attack you instead of its current target.
Likewise often one can use the comms to restore relationships with
hostile people.
Be careful as the local authorities may choose to scan your ship for
contraband. If you refuse to fly straight during this process you may be
attacked!

* 22) Transfer Command*

if you wish to transfer command to another starship, simply press '[' to
switch over. This is useful if you have died and do not wish to upset
the blaance. The AI that took over for the ship you left will attack
your previously targetted unit, be it friendly or enemy. You can use
this to in effect give orders to friends.

* 23) Turrets*

Turrets do not begin with their own AI at all times. To toggle the AI of
your turret, you must press 'o'. Pressing this when your turret is off
will turn on your turret and tell it to attack your target. Pressing o
again will turn off your turret and make it sit idle.
Turrets can be told to attack your target. do this by pressing
'shift-P'. once they attack your target you may switch your target and
they will continue to attack the target you told them to.

Press ']' to physically go to a turret.
Press ']' to return to cockpit again. Another press of ']' will get you
to your next turret, and so forth.
Like with Transfer command, the AI of the turret will attack your
previously targetted object when you leave the turret.

* 26) Changing Controls*

If you wold like to change the controls of Vegastrike, open either
vegastrike.config or vegastrike.config.2player
They will both have a section at the very top called "bindings":
<bindings>
<bind key="S" player="0" modifier="none"
command="Cockpit::SkipMusicTrack" />
The above will start the bindings section and then bind the "S" key to
SkipMusicTrack for player 0.
The player defaults to and should only be 1 in multiplayer.

<bind mouse="0" player="0" button="0" modifier="none" command="FireKey" />
This line will bind the FireKey command to the mouse button #0 (the left
button) for player 0. Button 1 and 2 will be the midle and right
buttons. After that, buttons are experimental...

<axis name="x" mouse="0" axis="0" inverse="false" />
<axis name="y" mouse="0" axis="1" inverse="false" />
This binds the axes of the mouse... should you wish the mouse to drag in
opposite direction set inverse to true.

<bind joystick="0" player="0" button="0" modifier="none"
command="FireKey" />
The previous line will bind the FireKey command to the joystick button
#0 for player 0. You can add as many buttons as you want, as long as
your joystick has them.

<axis name="x" joystick="0" axis="0" inverse="false" />
<axis name="y" joystick="0" axis="1" inverse="false" />
This binds the axes of the joystick... should you wish the joystick to
move in opposite direction set inverse to true.

</bindings>

* 27) Cockpit Views*

<cockpit1.jpg> <hud1.jpg>
 

On the left you see a screenshot of the cockpit
On the right you see a screenshot of the HUD (head-up-display) mode

You can use the following keys to switch between different views:

    * F1   cockpit/hud mode

      toggles between cockpit and HUD only mode, with/without background
    * You may have to press F1 several times to get back to the cockpit
      F2   left view

    * you're looking through the left window F3   right view
    * F4   backward view

    * you're looking behind you F5   follow-mode

    * the camera is positioned directly behind your ship and follows it
      F6   pan

      the camera is positioned outside your ship, showing your ship
      if you steer the ship (with cursor-arrows or joystick), the camera
    * will show different sides of the ship F7   follow target

    * shows your target F8   pan target

    * shows your fighter and your target F11  zoom in

    * works when you're looking at a target in modes F5-F8 F12 zoom out

There are the following instruments:

    * In the middle of the screen, there's the crosshair - it shows
      where you're gonna fire your lasers : 

      Use your joystick or keyboard arrows to steer your ship until the
crosshair is over your target - fire!

    * At the top left of the cockpit you see the message display: 
          o The game will print out messages for you to notify you of
            certain events (like the launching of new ships)
          o The 'story' will also be told on the message display
          o The first line of the message display shows the targeted
            flightgroup (yellow-2), the shiptype (tian), the AIname of
            your target (ignore it for now), and the current gametime
            (0.05 minutes)
          o The lines below are messages, they most current message is
            printed at the bottom of the list
          o you can scroll the list of messages up and down with pageup
            and pagedown keys


 

    * The Radar is located in the bottom middle of the cockpit: 

      use the radar to have an overview about what's going on
          o friendly ships are green blips
          o enemy ships are red blips
          o enemies which target you (and will attack you) are
            light-blue blips
          o neutral ships will be yellow
          o the currently targeted ship is painted twice as big as the
            other blips

    * Shield Display 


      shows your current shield status (front, back, left and right
      shields)

      Blue indicates the potency of your energy shields. As your shields
      absorb more energy they get closer to failing. When all blue lines
      are gone your starship itself (armor) takes damage. Armor is a
      thin layer of protection before actual internal damage is wreaked
      on your starship. How much interal structure after armor is
      depleted is not displayed on the status screen, but instaed in a
      video display

    * You have got two VDU (Video Display Unit):

       

       
       
       

      Left VDU               Right VDU: 

      each VDU can by cycled through different modes to see different views

          o press 'w' to cycle the left VDU
          o press 'v' to cycle the right VDU


      The Left VDU is weapon and defense VDU, and the right VDU is
      targetting and navigation. You can use each VDU for different
      options; however certain starships have merely 1 VDU that has some
      of the features of both VDU's. Look forward to more cockpits in
      the future.
       

    * the left VDU can be cycled between the following modes:

       
          o Weapons: show your selected weapons 

          o   Hull: shows your hull status 

          o   Shields: show ?your? Shield status 

                This your starships shield status in case the cockpit
      does not have view.
    *   the right VDU can be cycled between these modes:

       
          o Target status 

            This display shows on top the targeted flightgroup
            (yellow-2) and it's ship type (tian)
            At the bottom you can see the distance to the target
            In the middle you see the shield status of the target
            The target's hull is unknown from external scans.
          o   Navigation 

            shows the name of the system (Wasteland), the target ship
            type, and the relative location of the target
          o   various target camera modes

      Chapter 7: Writing Add On Adventures <#i29_3>
      Chapter 8: Conclusion <#i29_4>


      -------------------------------------------
      Chapter 1: Introduction
      -------------------------------------------

      Vega Strike has a powerful missions scripting interface that
      allows you to nearly modify Vega Strike at whatever level you
      choose, from the AI scripts (and the physics thereof) to the
      missions... to the overall plot and goal of the game.


      -------------------------------------------
      Chapter 2: Basic XML integration
      -------------------------------------------

      First let me start by explaining how to run a python class... in
      this case we start with the prebuild "privateer.py" script to run
      our mission.
      Open up mission/exploration/explore_universe.mission
      First come the variables that designate how the mission should
      normally start. By normally I mean if they don't have any save
      game present.

<mission>

    <variables>

        <var name="defaultplayer" value="blue"/>

        <var name="mission_name" value="Test Mission"  />

        <var name="num_players" value="2"/>

        <var name="credits" value="3500"/>

        <var name="difficulty" value=".05"/>

<!--good starting difficulty here-->

        <var name="splashscreen" value="bad_guys_vs_good_guys.bmp"/>

        <var name="system" value="sol_sector/celeste" />

        <var name="description" value="This is a fun mission."  />

        <var name="author" value="Me" />

        <var name="briefing"

value="In this mission, you will have to have fun, or you will fail."  />

        <var name="savegame" value="explore_universe_difficulty"/>

    </variables>


      it loads sol_sector/celeste.system as the star system (which is in
      XML and stores all present planets)
      After this, comes the actors in the mission, the flightgroups of
      fighters. If a mission has more than one player, then each player
      is the leader (first ship) in each respective flightgroup.

      <flightgroups>

               
<flightgroup name="blue" faction="privateer" type="wayfarer.begin" ainame="default"
waves="1" nr_ships="1">

            <pos x="20400"
y="-35400" z="84700000.0"/>



            <rot x="180.0"
y="180.0" z="180.0"/>

        </flightgroup>

    </flightgroups>


      The rot flag is ignored, and the position specifies the x,y,z
      coords of the blue flightgroup, which is of type wayfarer.begin.
      Notice that so far there are a lot of values you don't see for
      long in the default vegastrike game. Credits, System, first
      flightgroup fighter, difficulty--these are all initial values but
      can change.... since there is specified a savegame. The savegame
      makes the mission more of a campaign type mission where things may
      be saved to disk and reloaded at a later point. If no savegame
      variable is specified (this is where the autosave goes) then the
      mission will not save and will be a one time play mission.
      Future note:
      If you wanted to add a campaign to the privateer mission you would
      most likely modify privateer.py to have a campaign module get
      loaded.... so you wouldn't necessarily need to modify
      explore_universe.mission just to add a campaign... lets dig
      further into the meat of the scripting.

      If a mission has python tags...then it is a python mission and may
      have some embedded python in it. In this case the python makes a
      new python object of type privateer in the privateer.py module in
      the modules/ directory.

    <python>

from privateer import privateer

my_obj=privateer(20000,40000,500,3,2,.6,.25,.02,400000,2000)

    </python>


      You have to be careful about newlines, etc in the XML, but it
      shoudl usually work just dandy. You notice that the mission may
      pass in arguments to the privateer module that can make slight
      changes in teh gameplay. This allows many cargo missions to use
      the same module in order to change the parameters of the cargo
      missions.
      In this case the values I have selected appear to work relatively
      well.

      -------------------------------------------
      Chapter 3: Python Inheritance In Missions
      -------------------------------------------

      Ok lets dig further into the privateer.py module:

      It is a very short module written in more or less pure python... I
      say more or less for a very specific reason: it inherits from a
      C++ class!

      Director is a C++ class exported to python. All missions must
      inherit from director.... in this case the mission is very short
      as it uses other (pure python) modules.
      random_encounters.random_encounters, difficulty.difficulty and
      ,trading.trading all do NOT inherit from C++ as this class takes
      care of the C++ inheritance.

      The constructor __init__ takes the arguments that we passed in
      from the XML file and passes them on to the various submodules.
      The only really really important thing you do in the constructor
      is call

      Director.Mission.__init__ (self)


      if you do not do this, Vegastrike will not load your module and
      will silently fail (this calls the C++ constructor, whcih actually
      triggers the binding of your module to the python mission).

      Each mission module must have an execute function so that
      something can happen every physics frame. In this case it just
      calls execute on all the submodules... not very interesting.


      Missions also may have 2 functions Pickle (self) which returns a
      string with a XML mission file that will load the mission properly
      as well as a string representing the mission in serialized form...
      if the mission were reloaded that mission would be loaded and its
      corresponding python would be run, then Unpickle (self, str) would
      be called (with str being a string) and the expectation that the
      mission woudl be reloaded. data/newmission.py has an example of this.

      You may also choose to save data in a float by float format as
      follows (the advantage to this format is that it is saved on a PER
      PLAYER basis... so that each player may have a different value):
      there are 4 functions at your disposal for this older way to save
      missions:
      myindex=Director.pushSaveData(int whichplayer, stringkey,floatVal);
      this function adds the key for later retrieval (even after VS
      quits ) and pushes the float to the end of the hashtable indexed
      by stringkey

      This function modifies a index in a key that has already been
      pushed back at one point
      Director.putSaveData (intWhichPlayer, stringkey, myIndex, floatVal);

      Director.getSaveDataLength (int whichplayer, string key) gets the
      number of float values for a given player

      Director.getSaveData(int whichplayer, stringkey, int num) gets
      save data saved at that number

      You can make up stringkeys and save only 1 float per key if you
      wish... each key is allowed to have an vector of possible values.
      Use as you wish! For the privateer mission I save things with key
      31337ness and the one value in there is the difficulty that I
      write out....
      If a campaign is more global rather than player specific you may
      just choose to pickle it...however if something is on a per-player
      basis, it may be best going in these SaveData float vectors.


      With the exception of AI modules from here on out it's straight
      python.
      I will go over some of hte functions you can call inside Vega
      Strike in a minute.

      * 29) Python Inheritance with AI Scripts*

      Chapter 7: Writing Add On Adventures <#i29_3>
      Chapter 8: Conclusion <#i29_4>


      Let me talk about AI scripts briefly.

      you'll notice a nice AI script named printhello.py in the
      data/printhello.py
      It is very similar to a mission with a few notable differences.
      First of all the AI class you make must inherit from the class
      VS.PythonAI
      secondly instead of having an __init__ function it must have an
      init() function. The reasons for this have something to do with
      how inheritance works from C++, but this init function takes in
      self of course and the unit to which thie AI script belongs.
      init may start off some AI scripts from the get go, or you may
      wait until you execute each frame. in this case printhello loads
      the XML script ++turntowards.xml (which is the hard coded C++
      equivalent to ai/scripts/turntowards.xml).
      After loading that AI script it replaces its parents order with
      the last AI script, in this case the XML script.
      In the Execute function this AI script calls Execute on the hgiher
      level (which takes care of responding to communications) and then
      prints h to the console for no apparent reason.

      Lastly and most importantly, the AI sxcript makes a new class for
      itself...So when the C++ code executes printhello.py it will call
      the C++ constructor which will take care of binding it.

      so when you make a new unit like so:

      VS.launch
      (fgname,type,faction,"unit","printhello.py",nr_ships,nr_waves,vec,logo)

      it will have this python AI attached to it....
      However if you are too lazy to write AI's you can use the most
      excellent default AI
      VS.launch
      (fgname,type,faction,"unit","default",nr_ships,nr_waves,vec,logo)

      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      Chapter 5: Suppery about python-Vegastrike class relationships
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

      Summary:
      Missions must inherit from Director.Mission
      AI's must inherit from VS.PythonAI

      Missions must have an __init__ function with any number of
      arguments that calls
      Director.Mission.__init__ (self);
      to trigger the C++ binding

      AI's must have an init(self, un) function with those exact 2
      arguments... the second one is the parent Unit. I don't recommend
      you save the unit currently--I'm not sure if it will garbage
      collect the unit in that case... just call the self.GetParent ()
      function as the Ai script.

      Both AI's and Missions may have an Execute(self) function that
      does somethign each frame depending on the disired result.

      Missions may have a Pickle and Unpickle function in order to save
      and load the state of a campaign (this can be incredibly complex!)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Chapter 6 Python Vegastrike Bindings
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

      Vegastrike Utility Functions:

      Now that you can run complex python scripts that could even play
      minesweeper at the prompt, you probably want to interact with
      Vegastrike directly and "do" stuff like make ships, set
      objectives, and generally give the player a hard time.

      First of all let me talk about the "stubs". We have had a clever
      idea to make missions somewhat testable outside the framework of
      vegastrike by autogenerating stub functions.
      The way you make stub functions is by using the C++ processor in 2
      steps...

cd src/python
gcc -E -DPYTHON_STUB=1 unit_wrapper.cpp > ~/data/modules/stub/VS.py


      then edit that file and replace ~ with (newline)(space)(space)
      and you have a sample python stub so you can find out every
      mission that vegastrike exports.
      we try to keep these stubs as up to date as possible.
      Anyhow this lets you test your missions at the prompt by adding
      the two directories

import sys
sys.path = sys.path + ['/home/blah/data/modules']
sys.path = sys.path + ['/home/blah/data/modules/stub']
import VS
...

      and then you can run your mission and see if it at least sort of
      works.

      the stub file also gives you a good idea about what functions are
      available for you in your missions.

      I will try to give a brief description here...

      Feel free to add to the descritptions or to ask me about any that
      are unclear.
      I give you as follows the VS functions C++ names so you get type
      information as well!
      Note that these comments are also included in src/universe_util.h

//this function sets the "current" system to be "name"  where name may be something like
//"sol_sector/sol"  or "vega_sector/vega"   this function may take some time if the system
//has not been loaded before

	void pushSystem (string name);

//this function restores the active system.... there must be an equal number of pushSystems
//and popSystems or else Vega Strike may behave unpredictably
	void popSystem ();
//This function gets the current system's official name
	string getSystemFile();
//this function gets the current system's nickname (not useful)
	string getSystemName();
//this function gets an iterator into the units in the current system... do NOT keep an iterator
//across a frame--it may get deleted!
	un_iter getUnitList();
//This function gets a unit given a number (how many iterations to go down in the iterator)
	Unit *getUnit(int index);
//this function launches a wormhole or ajump point.
	Unit *launchJumppoint(string name_string,
			string faction_string,
			string type_string,
			string unittype_string,
			string ai_string,
			int nr_of_ships,
			int nr_of_waves, 
			QVector pos, 
			string squadlogo, 
			string destinations);
//this function launches a normal fighter  the name is the flightgroup name, the type is the ship type,

      Many of these functions return Unit * (for python just Unit)
      However there is a very critical difference between a Python Unit
      and a C++ Unit *.
      If you have a Python Unit you may keep it across frames... it may
      turn null (check with isNull()), but you can still keep it.... (if
      it dies is when it turns null)... in C++ if you keep a Unit *
      across a frame you WILL cause random segfaults (bad things, hard
      to find)
      but ya...Python it's safe to keep Unit's returned by
      functions...just be aware that between frames they may die and
      then bet tested Null with isNull().

      Chapter 7: Writing Add On Adventures
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      Honestly you merely need a basic understanding of python in order
      to craft your own add on adventures...but I decided to write a
      framework for consistently and speedily adding adventures to the
      general exploration of Vega Strike.

      I will define adventure as follows:
      A minature mission that gets triggered by a player who goes in its
      system.
      This mission may either be persistent or nonpersistent... a
      persistent mission will reload the next time the triggering player
      launched it until the player beats the mission.

      THE QUEST CLASS: THE ACTUAL QUEST LOGIC GOES HERE


      the quest, quest_factory and lastly the adventure modules take
      care of most of the dirty work...
      all an quest class has to do is the following:

class quest_my(quest.quest):
      def __init__ (self):
	  #do anything you need here
      def Execute (self):
	  #do anything you need here...return 1 if you wish to execute again, 0 if you wish to
	  #terminate yourself

      That's it.... Though there are some useful functions you may wish
      to call in your superclass
      self.removeQuest() #this prevents your player from EVER
      encountering the quest again in his life
      self.makeQuestPersistent() #this causes the quest to be loaded the
      next time your player jumps in after rebooting vegastrike

      generally before returing 0 (temrinating self) in a mission you
      may wish to make the quest either persistent (comes back next time
      he starts game) or removed... though you could also leave the
      quest the way it is and the next time the player goes to the
      system after rebooting vegastrike he'll get the same quest again :-)

      but in order for your quest to be complete you must have two more
      components

      THE QUEST FACTORY: A CLASS THAT RETURNS THE QUEST NEEDED

      each quest must have a factory that inherits from
      quest.quest_factory. and must define both an init, and a create
      function.
      optionally there's a conditional function called precondition....
      That returns a boolean whether or not the quest is ripe for
      creation (when a player encounters it in its native system that is)

class quest_my_factory (quest.quest_factory):
    def __init__ (self):
        quest.quest_factory.__init__ (self,"quest_my")
    def create (self):
        return quest_my()
    def precondition(self,playernum):
	return Director.getSaveData(playernum,"talked_to_sandra",0)>0

      The factory must have 2 and can have all 3 of the above functions
      first is the init function... y9ou must call your superclass's
      init with your name. second is the create function... this must
      simply return the quest class you painstakingly created above
      third is the precondition...this is optional (by default it
      returns 1...always true)

      the precondition can look in the save variables and see if you
      have done a task (set by some other quest perhaps) and only then
      return 1... :-) in that case when a player encounters it for the
      first time it will check the precondition before launchign the
      quest.... note the precondition does NOT get checked once the
      mission has been turned into a persistent mission.... this is
      because the mission already made the decision to make itself
      persistent I don't expect many missions to need to be
      persistent.... I expect more lighthearted adventures that don't
      drag out if a player quits, etc.

      Anyhow... a good example is the persistent quest known as the
      quest_drone (quest_drone.py)
      that quest checks to see if you're near an unknown_derelect and if
      so it launches the badguy drone.... it makes the drone jump and
      follow you wherever you go until it is destroyed...it is
      persistent and launches the drone every time you rerun the game....
      Luckily if you're close to the derelect chances are you'll find
      the gun that you can use to kill the drone.... which brings me
      right smack into my next point: location location location!

      THE LOCATION AND PERSISTENCE OF A GIVEN QUEST (i.e. HOOKING IT
      INTO privateer.py)
      adventure.py has the master list of all possible quests in vega
      strike....
      right now there are two (but one is stupid and will be removed
      soon enough...that's the default one)


adventures = {"gemini_sector/delta_prime":quest_drone.quest_drone_factory(),
              "sol_sector/celeste":quest.quest_factory("default_quest",0)}

persistent_adventures = [quest_drone.quest_drone_factory()]

      These are the only 2 lists that will ever need to be changed in
      the modules that are already there.
      adventures contains a map of location to adventure. Note that
      there can be only 1 adventure per location (hey players need to be
      encouraged to actually EXPLORE)
      the second list lists all possible persistent adventures (though
      they are only loaded from if the given adventure has gotten around
      to calling self.makeQuestPersistent)

      Anyhow just adding more cool missions to this list will make it a
      lot more fun to explore around and encounter strang epeople,
      strange news, and a bunch 'o cash :-P

      Note that we should eventually make the news reports line up with
      the quests... :-) I have some ideas how to do that
      Basically you can call
      VS.IOmessage ("game","news","A drone was sighted in the delta
      prime...blah blah blah")
      and then epople will see it in the game when they click on GNN
      likewise if you send it to
      VS.IOmessage ("game","bar","A drone was sighted in the delta
      prime...blah blah blah")
      then you can hear it when you talk to the bartender :-)

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Chapter 8: Conclusion
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Well this is the best I can do so far... please read this
      documentation over and let me know if you have any suggestions or
      clarifications...adn best yet give it a shot and try it out-- and
      at least look at modules/cargo_mission.py (whcih is called from a
      number of missions I think) as well as modules/privateer.py
      (called by mission/exploration/explore_universe.mission )
      And certainly try to understand modules/quest_drone.py
      before trying to write a quest (or while trying to write one)

      * 32) Troubleshooting*

      If you should encounter problems, then you should check these things:
      - Always check if Setup.exe is set to the closest options for your
      computer
      - Check the bottom of stdout.txt and stderr.txt to see if there
      are any errors. Then, send us an e-mail with those 2 files
      attached, along with a description of the mission you chose and
      what you did to cause it to:
      vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net
      <mailto:vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net>

      * 33) License*


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)


These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.


  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
