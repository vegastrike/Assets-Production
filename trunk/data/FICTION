The year is 2436 and humans' first colony ships have finally reached one of the
nearby stars.  When they got there, waking from their cryogenic sleep, the colonists were attacked by an alien species.  Responding to no radio hails, the ruthless aliens destroyed most of the colonies supply ships before the colonists could retreat.  
On the other end of the galaxy, the humans received some unwelcome guests of their own.  Apparently humans weren't the only colonists.  A band of advanced Aera fighter craft and supply ships have broken the front lines of Earth, and the Terran Confederacy can only hope their minimal defense is enough to stop them.
As commander of Earth's 191th wing of Nova class space superiority fighters, your first job is to protect the homeworld of humanity and stop the alien invaders. 
The Memphis, a cruiser orbiting near mars, appears to be the target of an incoming attack.  Your job: protect the memphis cruiser and stop the alien invaders.
