<title>Introduction to the Vegastrike Fixer system</title></head><body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is a Fixer?</h2>
            <p>
                A fixer is a sprite that can be placed in rooms around the base
                (as long as the rooms have specified "locations" for the fixers
                to exist in) to allow player interaction in campaigns and/or
                missions.  Most commonly, fixers are found in the bar to offer you
                various types of missions.  Adding a fixer of your own was a long
                and tedious process, and the results were often less than ideal.
            </p>
        
        <h2>If it's that hard, what is this document for?</h2>
            <p>
                Recently, a new fixer interface was implemented that allows the
                easy creation of fixers for scripted campaigns or missions.
                The new system, in keeping with the aim of the simulated universe,
                is dynamic, and can be made to change depending on the situation
                of the universe.  In addition, script writers are no longer
                limited to a simple question/answer interaction.  A whole
                "conversation" can be scripted, much like the interactions
                in games such as the Kings Quest series.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new system is what I will be teaching you to use in this
                document.
            </p>
        
    
    <h1>The Objects</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The classes you will be using to construct your fixer are found
                in the bases/fixers.py file.  The <strong>Conversation</strong>,
                <strong>Node</strong>, <strong>RootNode</strong>, and <strong>SubNode</strong>
                classes define the fixer and the interactions possible.
            </p>
        
        <h2>SubNode</h2>
            <p>
                This class defines the objects that contain the content of any
                conversation.  Each object can be created with content:
                <p><pre>
sn = SubNode("Ahh, that's right.  You're here about the jump drive!", [str(TRIGGER_SAVE) + '#' + str(TRIGGER_VALUE)], ["bases/fixers/no.spr|#\nimport quest_intro\nquest_intro.interactWithJenek(\"nojump\")|Sorry, what else do you have?", "bases/fixers/yes.spr|#\nimport quest_intro\nquest_intro.interactWithJenek(\"yesjump\")|Yeah, I'm interested."], "bases/fixers/merchant.spr", "Talk to Jenek about the jump drive.")
                </pre></p>
                Or each object can be created empty, and the content added later:
                <p><pre>
sn = SubNode()
sn.text = "Ahh, that's right.  You're here about the jump drive!"
sn.conditions = [str(TRIGGER_SAVE) + '#' + str(TRIGGER_VALUE)]
sn.choices = ["bases/fixers/no.spr|#\nimport quest_intro\nquest_intro.interactWithJenek(\"nojump\")|Sorry, what else do you have?", "bases/fixers/yes.spr|#\nimport quest_intro\nquest_intro.interactWithJenek(\"yesjump\")|Yeah, I'm interested."]
sn.sprite = "bases/fixers/merchant.spr"
sn.motext = "Talk to Jenek about the jump drive."
                </pre></p>
                <h3>What do I put in the value:  text  ?</h3>
                    This value contains the string that is displayed when the
                    fixer is clicked.
                
                <h3>What do I put in the value:  conditions  ?</h3>
                    This list contains the conditions that must all be satisfied
                    for the SubNode to be accepted.
                    
                    The condition can take the form of a SAVEVAR#VALUE pair,
                    which will return true if and only if the SaveData key in
                    the save game dictionary has its first value \=\= VALUE.
                    <p><pre>str(TRIGGER_SAVE) + '#' + str(TRIGGER_VALUE)</pre></p>
                    
                    An alternative form is also available, to allow for more
                    complete condition checking.  If the condition string is
                    preceded by a '#' character, then the string is assumed
                    to be python code and executed.  After the execution, the
                    value stored in the value "result" (this must be created
                    in the executed string) is taken to be the result (True/False)
                    of the condition.
                    <p><pre>"#\nimport quest_intro\nresult = quest_intro.buyDrive()==%s"%str(DRV_SUCCESS)</pre></p>
                
                <h3>What do I put in the value:  choices  ?</h3>
                    This string contains the information needed to create "Choice"
                    buttons for this SubNode.  The format is simple.  Seperated
                    by the "|" character are three fields.
                    The first is the path to the sprite for the choice (relative
                    to the sprites directory in the datadir).
                    The second is the string to be executed if the button is clicked.
                    Finally, the third is the text to display when the users
                    mouse moves over the button.
                
                <h3>What do I put in the value:  sprite  ?</h3>
                    The is a string containing the path to the sprite to be used
                    for the fixer.  Relative the the sprites directory in the datadir.
                
                <h3>What do I put in the value:  motext  ?</h3>
                    This is the string to display when the player moves his
                    mouse over the fixer in the room.
                
                
                    It should be noted that both the sprite and motext variables
                    are only needed for SubNode objects that will be add to a
                    RootNode object (as this is the only node the fixer gets its
                    creation information from).
                
            </p>
        
        <h2>Node</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Node</strong> class requires significantly less
                understanding than the <strong>SubNode</strong> class, as the
                data for the fixer has already been specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SubNodes belonging to the node can be referenced in a list
                when the object is created, or added later using the addNode method.
            </p>
        
        <h2>RootNode</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>RootNode</strong> class inherits from the <strong>Node</strong>
                class.  At the time of writing the only difference is an extra
                method, getInitialInfo method.  As a result, the <strong>RootNode</strong>
                class has the requirement that any <strong>SubNode</strong> child
                must have valid <emph>sprite</emph> and <emph>motext</emph> values.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Conversation</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Conversation</strong> class requires additional data
                about the conversation not presented in the <strong>SubNode</strong>.
                In addition to the list of nodes, the conversation class must
                have a valid name string (to reference the fixer), general
                preconditions (whether or not the fixer displays at all), and
                a string that contains the code to be executed if/when the fixer
                is clicked.  The conversation object must be accessible through
                the reference <emph>conversation</emph>.
                The iterate method will create the next set of text and buttons
                for the given node.
                <strong>Node</strong> objects can be added using the addNode method.
            </p>
        
    
    <h1>Creating a fixer</h1>
        <p>
            Well, other than what I've told you so far, and looking at examples,
            there isn't mush more that can be tought without doing.  That said,
            there are some details left out of the above descriptions that might
            come in useful to know ;-)
        </p>
        <h2>How can I add my fixer to the game?</h2>
            <p>
                These fixers, at least at this stage, are currently limited to
                being created by python code in various parts, most likely quests.
                To help scripters manage their fixers, there are some functions
                in the <strong>fixers</strong> module to help.
            </p>
            <p>
                <p><pre>queueFixer(playernum, name, scripttext, overwrite=0)</pre></p>
                The name is simply the name given to identify this fixer, and the
                scripttext is the string to be executed to retrieve the fixer.
                overwrite is more of a testing argument (may be removed in future!)
                that allows you to overwrite any fixer with the same name.  If
                overwrite is not set to 1 and a fixer is already queued with the
                same name, an error is outputted to the console and the fixer is
                <strong>not</strong> updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <p><pre>eraseCFixer(playernum, name)</pre></p>
                This is a lot easier to explain.  It deletes the first fixer with the
                matching name in the fixer queue.
            </p>
        
        <h2>How does this all work together?</h2>
            <p>
                At last, the easy bit to write!  This is actually quite simple.
                Assuming the fixer has been queued using the appropriate functions,
                when you dock, and the base screens are created, the following will occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                First each conversation in the queue is retrieved (by executing the string
                stored with the name), and the fixer objects are created.  Then,
                until the loading room is full (ie the bar has room for 3 fixers),
                each fixer has it's conversation preconditions evaluated, and if
                they are good the fixer is drawn using the information retrieved
                from the RootNode (which is <strong>mandatory</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                "But wait!" I hear you say.  "Aren't we able to add multiple
                possibilities for the fixers display via SubNodes?"
                The answer of course is yes.  In the display of each node, and
                this includes the RootNode, each of the SubNodes will have their
                conditions evaluated, with the first SubNode with all conditions
                returning true being used.  If none of the SubNodes in the Node
                evaluate as true, the last in the list will be used as a default.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last question I am able to think of at this late hour is, 
                "How do I end a conversation?"  This too is easy, simply make
                the last subnode used have no choice buttons created!
            </p>
        
        <h2>Executable Strings</h2>
            <p>
                Now to explain how to do the strings that hold code to be executed.
                ie the 'alternative' conditions, the choices, and the code
                referencing the <strong>Conversation</strong> object.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format of these strings is simple.  Each must be preceded by a
                # (hash) character.  Each must have each line of code seperated by
                the \n character, and each other special character (quotes,
                backslash) must also be escaped.  In addition, if used as a
                'condition,' the result must be stored in a variable called result:
                <p><pre>"#import module\nresult = module.testMethod()"</pre></p>
                If the string is used to retrieve the <strong>Conversation</strong>
                object, the object must be stored in a variable called conversation:
                <p><pre>"#import quest_module\nconversation = quest_module.getCon()"</pre></p>
            </p>
        
        <h2>Examples</h2>
