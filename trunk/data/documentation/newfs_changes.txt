- Mods' files have to be placed in datadir/mods/name_of_mod/ or in homedir/mods/name_of_mod/in order to be found and loaded
- To specify a mod to play use vegastrike -M name_of_mod and be sure that the mod's config file is in its mods/name_of_mod/ subdir

- Moved datadir/subdirs that contains sprites/textures into datadir/sprites/bases
- Moved the nav stuff :
	- moved meshes in datadir/meshes/nav/data
	- moved textures in datadir/textures/nav/default
	- moved nevdata.xml in datadir

Now :
- all bases graphics should be in datadir/sprites/bases
- new nav stuff should be placed in the datadir/textures/nav/ and in datadir/meshes/nav/
