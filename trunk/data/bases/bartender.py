        "There was an ISO discussion group in here last night. I let them use the bar, because they're good customers.  Some of them don't believe in money, though, so it can be kind of tense trying to collect on their tabs sometimes.  Mostly, I'm afraid if I push too hard, I'll come to work one afternoon and find my bar burned to the ground!  Crazy revolutionaries.",

They say they're close to developing an interstellar jump drive that doesn't need to utilize pre-existing wormholes!  It's incredible research because it's a wonder it's getting any funding.  They've been working on that for almost a century, and no progress!",

They were only sent here AFTER the Navy intel boys got through with them of course.  I wonder what they figured out, and if they're telling us everything.",

        "Contracts for defense research have skyrocketed since the Aera turned out to be hostile.  It's easy money if you're into starship or weapons design.  It drives the pacifist student groups wild, but the military has doubled the size of their officer training programs on university planets too.  Interesting times to be on a university planet.  Or anywhere, I guess.",

        "The Confederation authorities busted a local discussion group last month, and the fallout has been scathing.  Who thought that anyone would actually enforce that silly law they passed banning the Interstellar Socialist Organization?  I mean, they're radical and all...  but it was just a discussion group!",

        "A wing of fighters flew into port last week.  No-one I know saw who the pilots were, but everyone suspects that they were part of an ISO flightgroup.  My guess is that they were lying low for a while, waiting for some Confed heat to cool.  Small wonder they chose here, they've got all kinds of supporters on this kind of planet.",),

                    "So, clue me in on something - why do Andolians still sometimes go to bars if all they're going to order is water, and they won't even drink that until they run it through the purifiers in their suits? I mean, look around, it can't be for the ambiance. I tell you, sometimes it scares me trying to figure out what they're thinking inside those suits. Sitting in the back of my bar, staring at the wall and seeing something only the other linked can see - if I still had skin it'd give me goosebumps.",
                    "A couple of goons from the IntelSec came in here earlier looking for some guy named Jensen. Wouldn't say what it was about, but let me tell you, whatever it was, I was happy when they left. I swear, half the bar found excuses to be elsewhere the moment those two guys entered, and I don't blame them.",
                    "Shaper woman comes in here a few weeks back, wearing living clothes, naturally. Some drunken Purist, maybe he was a Luddite sympathizer or just really stupid, he comes up and starts yelling about how she's a desecration of the human species or some junk - next thing you know, some vine from her dress has the guy face down on the bar in a chokehold. Scary thing is, she didn't even bat an eye. She just was smelling the wine I'd just served her the whole time as if nothing was happening. When his unconscious body slid off my bar, I tell you the smile she gave me could have frozen helium.",
                    "A woman came in here the other day carrying one of those fancy Aera energy pistols in her belt. Don't ask me how she managed to get her hands on one of those, but even the roughest of my customers made sure to stay out of her way.",
                    "This captain of a Wayfarer came in here the other day, looking like she could really use a drink. I'd figured anyone flying a ship that many decades old might need a couple just to calm their nerves, but it turned out she had been chased by pirates across three systems! Persistant little buggers, aren't they? And the Regional Guard wasn't much help for some reason.",
                    "A mercenary outfit, the 'Red Condors', came in here a while ago. Real tough-looking types. I expected trouble, but they quietly finished their drinks and left. Glad there's still some professionalism out there.",
                    "There was this one merc in here the other day... he told me that he and the Aera he was fighting crashed on some world on the frontier. There was no human-edible food, so he said he lived off the dead Aera for three weeks! Can you believe that?",
                   "This Highborn youth and his lackeys come in last month - boy is total glutton, worst shape I've seen an aristo in in years. Apparently he's got speciesist tendencies among his failings too, because first thing he and his friends do is try to pick a fight with one of the Klk'k at the bar. Rest of the human bar patrons suddenly jump up from their seats in unison, completely clockwork-like - turns out they were all Andolian-steppers who were taking their Bro-chan out for a promotion party. As soon as that Highborn kid noticed the links on the backs of their necks... man, I don't know that I've ever seen a guy that out of shape run that fast.",
                    "Some privateer was in here a while back, bragging about his adventures in unknown space. He kept talking about these wonderful alien artifacts that he used to improve his ship. Claimed they were Betan... or was it Alphan? I can't remember, and I bet you 10 to 1 that chump couldn't have told the difference!",
                    "Every so often, an Uln comes in here. They have their own civilian sector pretty much like our own, and sometimes a couple of their privateers find their way across the border. But let me tell you, never give them beer. One of them had that, and he got into some sort of violent spasms and threw up over the whole bar. Not a pretty sight.",
                    "Hello there, friend. What can I get you? Sorry, I don't have any of the good stuff left. I had a transport bringing in new beverages from the Uln border, but there was an... accident. Apparently, some of that stuff is more flamable than napalm! How was I to know?",
                    "I think that the craziest story I've ever heard in this bar...  is where this pilot says he was out on the Aeran frontier, flying alone in an uncolonized system. He's running pretty much with zero emissions, so no Aera patrols can spot him. He's thirty thousand clicks out from the jump point, when his passive sensors go CRAZY. He says thats when a sparkling, glowing green orb popped out of the jump point, and just took off to another jump point at insane speeds. The pilot sold his ship right after he left my bar.",
                    "...and so there I was. Regional Guard patrol to my port, Confed fighter wing to my starboard... and my dumped cargo coasting slowly away from me about 600 kliks to stern. I thought I was home free. Suddenly, they all started powering up their weapons. 'I'm fracked', I thought. Turns out there was a wing of Aeran Nicanders on an attack vector. Then I thought 'Now I'm REALLY fracked'.",
                    "There was a guy in here the other day who claimed he was the sole survivor of some colony massacre by the Aera out on the frontier. No one believed him for a minute though - if the Rlaan ever caught the Aera slaughtering a colony's worth of civilians, the Rlaan would be massing on the Aeran border in a heartbeat.",
                    "My brother signed up for the New Farmers of the Confederation program, and got shipped out to a new agricultural colony out on the frontier. I got a trans from him last week, and he said that life was really hard compared to Mars, but that he was happy to be living on a surface habitable planet finally.",
                    "By Jupiter, there are some crazy people out there.  Just last week, a shipment of industrial goods destined for the base here got shot up by a wing of Luddite fighters. It's insane!  They lash out against modern technology, but they use the latest weapon systems and starfighters to do it!",
                    "There's got to be someone behind the Luddites. I mean, fanatical social reactionaries don't have the money or the resources to buy ships, train pilots, or construct highly organized terrorist operations all by themselves, even with a bunch of whacked out, tithing followers.  Now who would stand to gain from the Luddite craziness?  Hmmm....",),

                "There's a lot of people complaining about the pirates, but I don't mind them so much.  The Confed and the Merchies know they need a running merchant operation in the outlying systems, but they haven't got the resources to patrol every trade lane for pirates, so they need people who can look after themselves.

        "We might have had some luck raiding some of the outlying Aeran outposts, but I hear their planets are going to be a tough nut to crack. An old friend of mine from the HCS Zhukov told me that, back during the Rlaan-Aera war, they tracked a Rlaan battle fleet as it entered orbit around one of the planets, but then it simply disappeared off their scopes! The fleet that is, not the planet.",
        "So what's your take on the war? A friend of mine in the Navy told me that the Aera-Rlaan border is still deadly silent. Word is that the unofficial cease-fire might as well be an official one. Some are even saying the Aera might redeploy even more of their fleet units from that front. If that happens, the Aera will bring all of their high-tech weapons to bear on us, and I don't just mean those poor bastard in Forsaken space. Things aren't looking good.",
        "It's hard to tell what this war with the Aera is going to be like, because we aren't really into it yet. I suggest you don't put too much weight on the first few skirmishes... I suspect we'll be in this one for the long haul.",
        "Have you heard that the 5th Fleet and the 9th Fleet are actually made up of mostly the same ships?  It's the 5th Fleet when under Admiral Johansson, and the 9th when under Admiral Nogura. The 3rd and the 4th Fleets are the same way. I hear it confused the hell out of the Aera for a while. They thought we were magically growing new fleets out of our armpits!",
        "I've got a sister in the Navy. She's a weapons officer in the 6th Fleet out near the Aera-Confed-Shmrn border. I asked her to fry a few aliens for me, but so far neither side is committing in full to that sector. To be honest, I still hope she doesn't have to actually fight against a full on Aeran assault - it's murder out there, but I wanted her to think I wasn't worried.",
        "I've got a buddy in the Confed Marines, attached to the 10th Fleet. He's out on the Rlaan border, corward of Shaper space, the complete opposite side of the Confederation from the fighting. He complains about it being boring out there... but if I was him I'd be pretty happy.",
        "There's a rumor going around that the Aera have some big capital ships deep inside their home territory. I don't mean just big... I mean BIG big. Big enough to use one of the old Starrunners for a pinnace. Then again, it's just a rumor.",
        "I've heard that the Aera don't have a very well-defined concept of 'prisoners of war'. The Rlaan help keep them honest when it comes to civilians, but I hear that the Navy started to give cyanide pills to pilots in case the wrong side picks them up after they bail out.",
        "The Aera might seem to be more powerful than us at first glance... but how much of their economy is dedicated to war? Most of it, I'd say. The Confederation spends only a few percent of its gross product on the military. If push comes to shove... we'll knock 'em over for sure, provided we can ever get the Senate to agree to anything useful before the whole bloody war is over!",
        "I've heard that the Confed Navy has been trying to slip intel teams behind and around Aeran lines to set up listening posts. I'd hate to be working that duty...  out there, all alone. Only kilometers away from Aeran fleets. Always afraid of being discovered...  brrrrr.",
        "You know what they say... 'War is good for business'?  Well it ain't true. How many pilots that were regulars here have been drafted?  How many freelancers have gotten fried on escort duty?  A lot.  That's a lot of people NOT buying drinks from me.  Lousy war.",
        "Have you heard about the anti-war protests back home?  I could understand that if we were invading Aera space, being aggressive and all...  but those protesters have NO idea what's going on out on the Frontier, do they?  Not one damn clue!  Maybe someone should send them out to the Justman Colony, so they can see just how 'peaceful' the Aera really are!",),

Some of my buddies in Navy Intel have been telling me that they desperately need Aera weapon systems to analyze. I'm willing to bet that there would be some GOOD money in it for anyone who ran some Aera guns over to the Confed side and dropped them off at an R&D facility - provided they were still operational.",

Kept enough for this bar, though.",

We don't have any orbital defenses, no fighter wing... heck, we don't even have a ground battery. All it would take is one Aera bomber with a fusion warhead to take out half the colony!

Some people just can't take the shock of all the heavy machinery and laborer robots that take over practically overnight. I respect wanting to live in the fashion of your ancestors as much as the next fellow, but trying to reverse half the societal changes and opportunities of the last millenia is just crazy talk.",

He's the pirate captain that entered an ion storm and flew out again without a scratch, while his three militia pursuers were never heard of again. Then there's this story going around of how he single-handedly took out a Confed Missile Cruiser, but if ya want my opinion, I think that one's bunk.",

You figure the guys at HQ would be smarter than that. At least we aren't seeing any Andolian deserters, if there even are such things. Most of us around here figure that if we ever see one, it's a sure sign the war is lost.",

                "You know, if we lose the war against the Aera, it probably won't matter much, because the majority of us won't be around to see it, but what if we win? The whole fleet would return to peacekeeping duties in human systems, and it would mean the end of space piracy as we know it!",
