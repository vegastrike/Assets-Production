"Areus","starships/restricted",1,216,4400,"More a fighter than a bomber, this is the secondary assault craft the Aera rely on, after the Agis. These light assault craft are commonly seen as escorts to the larger, more dangerous Agis class assault corvettes, though it is not uncommon to see wings of Areus detatch to spearhead assaults on subcapitals and support vessels. While larger and not as nimble as fighters or interceptors, the Areus is perfectly well equipped to engage any smaller craft foolish enough to wander near its gun sights. Armament on the Areus isn't well suited to assaulting capital vessels directly, but is entirely sufficient for destroying subcapitals, support craft, or softening up craft too large to destroy outright with the limited payload available. The Areus is almost never seen in defensive operations outside of the aforementioned escort of larger strike forces."

It also offers a number of luxuries to the pilot as well, and those that have flown the Gawain consider it an experience to which little can compare.  Like all Highborn vessels, it is known for its durability and reliability even under the worst conditions.  Its features come at a great price, however, and it is one that few can afford.
