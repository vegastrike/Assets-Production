<!--

    A technique that won't compile under the current
    hardware will use the "fallback" technique, if specified.
    If a technique fails to compile and no callback is specified,
    an error condition arises

    Passes are rendered in sequence, as specified by "sequence".
    
    When a pass is rendered, one can assume all passes (of all techniques) of
    lesser sequence have been rendered already. Within same-sequence passes,
    opaque passes are rendered first, and transparent last. A pass is said to
    be opaque if the destination color plays no part in the blending mode.
    
    Parameters:
    
    iteration: "once" means the pass will be executed only once. A number
        specifies the number of lights which this pass can handle in one
        execution. The pass will be executed as many times are necessary
        to process all lights.
    
    maxiterations: A number that specifies, under iterated execution, the
        maximum number of times the pass is allowed to be executed. 0 is a special
        value that means "infinity"
    
    blend: The blending mode of the pass. Default uses the blending mode of the
        mesh being rendered by the pass.
    
    sequence: A number specifying the sort order of the pass.
    
    depth_function: The depth-testing function used. "always" will disable depth tests.
    
    cull: The backface culling mode. Notice that "front" culls front faces - ie, does NOT
        draw frontfaces. Default is whatever the mesh/context specifies, usually "back".
    
    polygon_mode: The polygon drawing mode. Defaults to the usual, "fill"
    
    polygon_offset_units: A floating point number that specifies the 
        z-buffer offset in "delta units".
    
    polygon_offset_factor: A floating point number that specifies the
        z-buffer offset as a slope factor.
    
    line_width: A floating point number that specifies, when in "line" polygon
        mode, thewidth of the rendered lines.
    
    srgb_aware: If true, shaders are aware of SRGB frambuffers, so everything should be set up
        for sRGB blending if sRGB framebuffers are available. Shaders will be compiled
        with SRGB_FRAMEBUFFER set to 0 (not supported) or 1 (supported).

    Defines a texture unit to be set up for the pass.
    
    target: a texture unit number. In the fixed-function pipeline,
        0 = diffuse
        1 = specmap
        2 = damagemap
        3 = glowmap
    
    src: a texture source, of the form "<type>:<path>". May be:
        decal:<number>
            The mesh texture number <number>
        environment
            The environment spheremap (or cubemap, depends on build configuration)
        file:<path>
            A specific texture file
    
    default: a default texture source, in case the 'src' cannot be found.
        Follows the same format as 'src'.
    
    name: A shader parameter name used to bind a program with its texture unit.
        Required for shader passes, ignored for fixed-function passes.
    
    kind: a texture kind, unused for "environment", sice it has an implied kind.
        2d: a normal 2-d texture (the default for file and decal)
        3d: <unimplemented> a 3-d texture. 
            Currently, only the DDS format supports this kind.
        cube: <unimplemented> a 6-side cubemap.
            Whatever the kind of the first side is, this kind expects 6
            faces concatenated to a single file, in the order
            <unspecified>
        separatedCube: <unimplemented> a 6-side cubemap.
            This kind expects its sides to be found with name suffixes:
                up/down/left/right/front/back
        default: a context-dependant default value. For decal and file
            sources, this usually means 2d. For environment, dependant on
            build flags, it means either 2d (spheremap) or cube.
