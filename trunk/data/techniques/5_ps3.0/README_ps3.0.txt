Techniques in this folder specify shaders compatible with any ps3.0 gpu's.

From http://www.gpureview.com/pixel-shader-version-article-390.html:
"
PS3.0 - Most notably added dynamic flow control making the gpu much more like a general
processor (cpu). Also removed the ceiling on most instruction limits entirely and raised
other limits significantly. This model is supported by all GeForce 6 Series and higher
and all Radeon X1000 series and higher.
"

This ps3.0 folder contains 3.0 techniques that should run on even the earliest
ps3.0 gpu's, such as the 6600gt, and with an acceptable frame-rate.
