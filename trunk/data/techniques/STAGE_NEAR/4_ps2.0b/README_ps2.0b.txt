Techniques in this folder specify shaders compatible with ps2.0a and ps2.0b gpu's.

From http://www.gpureview.com/pixel-shader-version-article-390.html:
"
PS2.0a - Usually refers to the extended PS2.0 version supported by nVidia's GeForce FX line. Essentially a quarter of the way to full blown PS3.0. It supported far more instructions and features than the PS2.0 specification required.
PS2.0b - Refers to the shader model supported by the Radeon X700/X8*0 series. Could handle more instructions than PS2.0, but was still behind PS2.0a in instruction limits and features.
