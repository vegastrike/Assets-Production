Techniques in this folder specify shaders compatible with any ps4.0 gpu's.

From http://www.gpureview.com/pixel-shader-version-article-390.html:
"
PS4.0 - Significantly raised nearly all instruction limits, added integer operations, tightened handling of floating point numbers, as well as tons of other features. This model is supported by all GeForce 8 Series and higher and all Radeon X2000 series and higher. This is generally considered to be a much more significant upgrade than was PS3.0.
"

This ps4.0_lo folder contains rather simple 4.0 techniques that should run on even
all current (as of this writing, Feb 2010) ps4.0 gpu's.
