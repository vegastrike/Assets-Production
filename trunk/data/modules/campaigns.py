hitsuccess="Hit on Atlantis:\\\\In yet another twist in the underworld wars raging through the Crucible sector, a little known cargo hauler, who cannot be named, is suspected dead after taking delivery of a shipment specified as \"Recycled Plastics.\"  With hangars CA-47 to CB-55 suffering irrepairable damage, investigators believe the entire shipment must have consisted of plastic explosives.  With such a scene an unfortunately common occurence in recent years, industry is quick at recovering.  Business is expected to return to normal at the spaceport Tuesday week, once remains of the 35 suspected dead have been found and identified.\\\\GNN -- Providing news for the galaxy."

confedwin="IntelSEC Investigation Completed:\\\\IntelSEC has today completed the preliminary investigation into a group of pirate organisations.  Operating out of Crucible Sector, in particular the system Cephid 17, this organisation has been found responsible for many offences, including many counts of murder, credit fraud, and several asassinations.  So far however, only the details relating to the counts of credit fraud have been made publically available.\\\\This is good news for the citizens of the surrounding systems.  The removal of the pirate menace has already seen local stockmarkets boom, and the Merchant's Union has already made plans to reopen disbanded trade routes.\\\\Aside from the criminals, the only others to lose out are several of the smaller financial institutions of the area.  Now compelled to reimburse the victims of the credit fraud, and with little hope of benefitting from the selloff of the pirates' assets, their share price has dropper by as much as 20% in the case of \'Crucible Holdings.\'\\\\GNN -- Local news, for a galactic audience."

piratewin="IntelSEC Investigation Cancelled:\\\\IntelSEC has today cancelled their investigation into alledged criminal organisations operating out of Crucible Sector.  Citing the murder of an investigating operative, as well as the general lack of anyone willing to provide testimonies, the agent leading the probe expressed his disappointment at the result.  \"Such an outcome will only serve to strengthen the grip of these organisations on the outer systems.  Every system with a pirate infestation is one that is lost to the Confederacy.\"\\\\The share markets in the involved systems took a battering today, with the only winners the smaller financial institutions.  Faced with claims of credit fraud, many have been quite lacklustre in their attempts to reimburse victims.  Some victims, 12 months later, still have their claims being assessed.\\\\GNN -- Local news, for a galactic audience."
