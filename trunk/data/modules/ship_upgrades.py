#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Right now, there are no engines in the upgrades list.
#    But, anyway, I left the Engine/Reactor dual upgrade system.
#    Engines will always fail, without more consequences than an error
#    messages, but if after balancing they get reintroduced (which makes
#    sense, somewhat), or if other mods require them (also possible),
#    then it makes sense to leave it.
