# To be merged with fixers.py???
#
# How to di it all:
# + first add the fixer to the (unique) queue, this should be the string to be
#   executed to create the \'Fixer\' object.
# + when getting fixers, first get campaign fixers, then add quest fixers...
#   print (or throw?)error if too many
# + each node should have seperate preconditions, each 'ref' value in iterateConversations
#   will then be a hash seperated string of various possible nodes, with preconditions evaluated
#   linearly until the last...which is accepted without preconditions evaluated.
# + The 'Root' node is in fact just the preconditions for displaying the fixer and, where
#   the text would be, just the reference list of possible starting points for the conversation.
#   The rest of the data in this string is ignored.
# Library to help in the creation of fixers

#Segments are seperated by the '^' character, elements (within each segment) by the '|'
#The first segment has two elements, the first is the reference, the second the precondition for node activation.  This precondition, if it exists, will be ignored for references not equal to 'Root'.
#Each additional segment (minimum of 1) contains a possible value for this node.  Each (in the order the are written) have their preconditions evaluated.  The first to get the 'all clear' becomes this node, the text and choices are evaluated (and if the reference of the node is 'Root', then so are the sprite and mouseover values) and used.
